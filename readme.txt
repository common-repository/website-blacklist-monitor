= WEBSITE BLACKLIST CHECK AND MONITOR =

Google blacklists more than 12,000+ websites every day. You can loose up to 99% of traffic if your website has been blacklisted. Google protects its users from dangerous websites that may show up in search results and if your website has dangerous behaviour it gets banned by Google and you loose customers and visitors. Google Chrome blocks all your visitors from accessing your site. It is extremely important to keep an eye on your website security and monitor if it gets blocked by Google or other search engines.
